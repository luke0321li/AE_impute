# Self-supervised Epigenomic Imputation using Autoencoders

We propose a novel and resource-efficient approach that enables joint imputation of multiple epigenetic data tracks through denoising autoencoders neural networks that allow prediction of missing data by learning their relations with observed data.

A brief description is included in the <code>Write-up</code> folder.
